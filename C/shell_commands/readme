cp, cmp, tail

1) cp.c is equal to shell cp
BUT there are a few differences:
    -no flags available
    -it takes 2 arguments only:
    -first one has to be an existing file which is possible to open for readonly
    -second one can be either:
        -existing file which is possible to open for writeonly. In this case it
         will be rewritten.
        -non-existing file which can be cteated. It this case it is created with
         the same rights as the first argument file.
    -error diagnostics can differ a bit but they are close to the original ones
    -return values:
        -0 if everything worked fine
        -ERR_MISS_OP = 1 - missing file operand
        -ERR_MISS_DEST = 2 - missing destination file operand
        -ERR_MANY_ARGS = 3 - too many arguments
        -ERR_NON_EXIST = 4 - No such file
        -ERR_WRITE = 5 - write error
        -ERR_STAT = 6 - stat error
        -ERR_OPEN = 7 - destination file open error

2) cmp.c is equal to shell cmp
BUT there are a few differences:
    -no flags available
    -it takes 2 arguments only (cannot be one!!!):
    -both have to be an existing files which are possible to open for readonly
    -error diagnostics can differ a bit but they are close to the original ones
    -return values:
        -0 if everything worked fine
        -ERR_MISS_1 = 1 - missing first operand
        -ERR_MISS_2 = 2 - missing second operand
        -ERR_MANY_ARGS = 3 - too many arguments
        -ERR_NON_EXIST = 4 - No such file
        -ERR_WRITE = 5 - write error

3) tail.c is equal to shell tail
BUT there are a few differences:
    -only 1 flag possible: -n
    -it takes either 1 or 3 arguments:
    -if there is no -n flag:
        -only argument has to be an existing file which is possible to open
         for readonly
    -if there is -n flag:
        -first argument is -n flag exactly
        -second argumentis either +NUM or NUM/-NUM
         where num is number of lines in long diapason
        -third argument has to be an existing file which is possible to open
         for readonly
    -error diagnostics can differ a bit but they are close to the original ones
    -return values:
        -0 if everything worked fine
        -ERR_MISS_OP = 1 - missing file operand
        -ERR_WRONG_ARG = 2 - wrong argument list
        -ERR_MANY_ARGS = 3 - too many arguments
        -ERR_NON_EXIST = 4 - No such file
        -ERR_DIAPASON = 5 - number of lines out of diapason
        -ERR_WRONG_NUM = 6 - invalid number of lines
        -ERR_WRITE = 7 - write error
        -ERR_LSEEK = 8 - lseek error

Created to test programs (6 sections). For more information check "Makefile"
